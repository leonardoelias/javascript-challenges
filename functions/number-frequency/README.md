# Number Frequency

### Finding the Most Frequently Occurring Number

Given an array of numbers, find the most recurrent number.

For example, given `[1, 2, 3, 4, 3]`, your algorithm should return `3`, as it
has the highest level of recurrence. For ties, return the first found more
recurrent number.

### Getting Started

The file you will be editing is `most-recurrent.js`.

The `most-recurrent-test.js` file includes a test suite to run your code against.

Run `node most-recurrent-test.js` to run the test suite in full. As you
write code to pass tests, make sure you unskip succeeding tests by changing
`test.skip` to just `test`.
